let firstName = "";
let lastName = "";
let nickName = "JCSS";
console.log( firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous");
console.log( firstName || lastName || nickName && "Anonymous");

The or operand finds the first "truthy" value from left to right and
converts each operand to boolean. if the result if true, it stops and returns 
the original value of that operand. In the case of 
firstName || lastName || nickName || "Anonymous", we are looking for the 
first non-empty string (empty string evaluates to false), which is nickName.
It thus returns the original value of nickName, which is "JCSS".

The and operand finds the first "falsy" value, but if all were evaluated to true, 
it returns the last operand. In the case of "firstName || lastName || nickName && "Anonymous",
&& has precedence over ||, so nickName && "Anonymous" is evaluated first. So now the rest of 
the operation looks like "firstName || lastName || "Anonymous". Since firstName and lastName 
are evaluated to false (empty strings), the or operand will return Anonymous because it's
the original value of the first element that evaluated to true.
