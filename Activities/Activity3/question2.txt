When the child object is created, we set name to 'Stacey', age to 35, and heritage to 'Irish'.
However, after that, we set the child's name to "Ryan" and the age to 35. The heritage persists
as is. Thus, Line 5 prints "Ryan" since we set the name to be that. Line 6 prints "Irish"
because our initial declaration persists. Line 7 prints undefined since height does not 
exist (was not ever declared).
