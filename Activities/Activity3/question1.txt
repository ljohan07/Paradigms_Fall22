In 0 == "0", Javascript coerces the type conversion from "0" to 0.
Thus, this statement evaluates to true. Similarly, in the second statement,
Javascript tries to force the type conversion and succeeds. For an array,
the ToPrimitive function is called, which returns 0 for an empty array
when comparing it to an int value. Thus, the second statement returns true.
For the last statement, since we are comparing an empty array to a string, 
the ToPrimitive function does not execute as we had hoped, so the
comparison returns false.
