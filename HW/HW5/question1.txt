defer tells us that the script is meant to be executed after the document has been parsed. the browser will process the HTML, 
load the script in the background, and then runs the script once everything is built
async tells us that the script is separate. it is different for the following reasons: the browser doesn't block the script (the way defer does),
async scripts don't wait for other things and vice versa
