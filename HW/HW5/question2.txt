we put the css link in the header so that it is rendered the first time with the rest of the website
if we put the css link in the body, the website will render the elements that come before the link
and then re render once it comes across the css link

we put the js script right before the end of the body so that all the elements of the body in html have been rendered
this way, once we execute the js scripts, we have all the pieces that would potentially be used in the js script
otherwise, we will have elements that show up as null because they have not yet been rendered.
