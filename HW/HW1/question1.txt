The reason why comparison(-1) prints "undefined" has to do
largely with the fact that the else block uses let instead of
var. When you use let, it can only be used within a block scope,
so let result = "Negative" only exists as such within that 
else block. Outside, it does not exist, thus console.log(comparison(-1))
prints "undefined."
