The thin arrow function -> hijacks the value of 'this' to
the value of the calling context. In the call to innerFn, 
this matters. Since it accesses values not passed into it, 
in print2, the value of 'this' is undefined ('this' is given
the calling context, undefined). Therefore,
innerFn in print2 cannot access this.x nor can it 
access this.y.
